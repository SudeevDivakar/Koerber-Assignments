-> We first create a Dockerfile inside the currencyexchange folder (producer) and create an image of it.
docker build -t currencyexchange .

-> We then open the currencyconversion folder (consumer) and change the code where we configure the url we send a request to,
@FeignClient(name = "currency-exchange", url = "http://currencyexchange:8000")  // Over here, 'currencyexchange' is the name of the container which we will create for the currencyexchange service.

-> We now set up a dockerfile in the currencyconversion folder and create an image of it
docker build -t currencyconversion .

-> We then need to set up a docker network with the following command,
docker network create currency-application

-> We now run the images we created with names matching the ones we mentioned in our api call url (open-feign).
docker run -d --name currencyexchange -p 8000:8000 --network currency-application currencyexchange
docker run -d --name currencyconversion -p 8100:8100 --network currency-application currencyconversion

-> The project should work properly now.
